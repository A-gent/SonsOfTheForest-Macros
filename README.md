# SonsOfTheForest-Macros
A small collection of macros to make SOTF a little bit easier to play.
<br /> <br /> <br />
Macros included: <br />
AutoRun (Alt+Q) <br />
Auto E Pickup (Alt+E) <br />
Auto C Store (Alt+C) <br />
Auto Clicker (Alt+Left Click) <br />
<br /> <br />
Navigate to the [Releases page here](https://github.com/A-gent/SonsOfTheForest-Macros/releases) and download <b>ONE</b> of the following files from the 'FIRST RELEASE' listed there: <br /> 1.) "SOTF Macros.ahk" <br /> <b>OR</b> <br /> 2.) "SOTF Macros.exe" <br /> If you choose the .AHK file you need to install [Autohotkey v1.1](https://www.autohotkey.com/download/ahk-install.exe). Which you choose to use is your choice, they are both the exact same thing but if you just use the compiled .EXE version, it is not required to install Autohotkey.
<br /> <br />
Place the file anywhere inside of a folder of your choosing.
<br /> <br />
On launch, a configuration file for the script will generate with default settings provided inside of the folder where the script is, if it does not already exist (which it won't on your first ever boot up). If you ever want to reset settings to default, just delete this configuration file and relaunch the script to rebuild it. Inside of this configuration file, you can edit the speeds that everything executes at. The only setting I recommend you don't touch is the 'TurnOffAutoRunVel' option. -150 is what it needs to be. Otherwise, you can edit the rest of them to your liking.
